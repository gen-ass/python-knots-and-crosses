# Python noughts and crosses
The classic game of noughts and crosses. The code in the game is copied from a instruction video. All credit should go to Luke and Mark which coded this game in about 30 minutes.

# Learning from seeing
The value of the video was mostly in seeing how to think programmatically and to solve road blocks as you code.
